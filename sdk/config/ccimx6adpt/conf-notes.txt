Digi Embedded Yocto provides two target images:

  * dey-image-minimal: command line busybox-based image

    This image does not support the X11 window system so in order to build
    it you need to add the following line to the project's conf/local.conf:

    DISTRO_FEATURES_remove = "x11"

  * dey-image-graphical: graphical X11-based image with SATO theme
