# U-Boot bootscript for EMMC/SD images created by Yocto.

# To detect if we are booting from SD card we get the UUID of the
# boot partition and compare with the default one for the EMMC
part uuid mmc ${mmcdev}:${mmcpart} bootpart
if test "${bootpart}" != "${part1_uuid}"; then
	setenv mmcroot /dev/mmcblk${mmcdev}p2
